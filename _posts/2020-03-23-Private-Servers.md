Hello, everyone!

If you're looking for something to pass the time, you may be interested in our new **private servers**! 

While currently in Beta stages, we have developed an infrastructure for our new party system that can be accessed using `/party`. This will create a private server loaded with PGM for you to play with up to 20 friends, on all the maps we have available [in this repository](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/maps). To set a map, use `/setnext <map>` and to cycle to it, use `/cycle`.

It's not a party without friends! To invite friends to play, tell them to join using `/server <your name>` - servers will automatically generate with your IGN. If there's any unwelcome guests, feel free to use `/whitelist` to manage whitelist and restrict who joins.

We welcome your feedback! Tackling large-scope features like this requires a lot of input regarding implementation, so if you wish to contribute, feel free to drop your comments in the `#feedback` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CvJGbrV)!
