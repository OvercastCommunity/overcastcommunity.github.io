For a long time we have discussed opening up new map submissions, and now it is finally happening!

The submission window is going to be open indefinitely, so no worries about submitting your map super fast. This post will go through the submission process, and will also include a template you will need to use at the bottom. Submissions that do not meet the requirements listed in this post and in the template will be closed, so be sure to read everything!

## FAQ

### I dont know XML, what do i do?

If you need help with your XML you can read through the documentation over at [pgm.dev](https://pgm.dev) or ask for help in #maps in our Discord. (There is also currently a tool in development which will make anyone be able to make XML on a public map dev server)

### Can my submission get closed for inactivity?

Yes, if you get a response on your submission make sure to respond to it before 7 days has passed. Any submission with a reply from a map dev which is inactive for 7 days will be closed. Do not re-open closed issues!

### What happenes if my submission gets accepted?
If your submission gets accepted for testing, hooray! Your map will be added to a pool of maps which will be tested on public servers. If more changes are needed before putting the map up on the public rotation feedback will be posted on the same issue you originally opened.
