title: Community Spotlight&#58; PGM Tracker
author: Brottweiler

Minetrack is a tracker for the largest Minecraft servers. Now there is one for PGM servers as well!

Community member, and recent OCC Administrator **applenick**, has forked the [Minetrack](https://www.minetrack.me/) Minecraft server tracker and added any known PGM servers to the list. You can easily and conveniently see how many players each server has right now, how many are playing PGM in total, and what the player record has been for each server!

Check it out at [pgm.fyi](https://pgm.fyi/)!

If you want your *public* PGM server to be added to the list, let **applenick** know in the #servers channel on our [Discord](https://oc.tc/discord)!
