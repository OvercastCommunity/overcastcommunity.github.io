# FAQ

### What is Lunar Client?

[Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) is a client developed by Lunar Network. With support for several versions of Minecraft, Lunar Client optimizes the PvP experience, boosts frames, and is 100% free. We believe it's simply the best player experience, especially on PGM. You can **[download](https://www.lunarclient.com/download/)** it today on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### What can we expect?

We're eager to work with Lunar on many fronts. Lunar users may have already noticed the addition of Overcast to the partnered server list. Now you can easily join the server with a single click right from the launcher.

As mentioned, we're bringing some really cool cosmetics to the Lunar Store. These cosmetics will be available for purchase and are a great way to show your support for Overcast!

Finally, you can expect to see some new technical advances coming very soon. We'll have more details to share on this at a later date.

### What about Badlion?

Due to contract limitations, our partnership with Badlion will be ending at this time. If you have a Badlion OCC Cloak, you will keep it on your character, but it will be unavailable for purchase from the Badlion Store.
