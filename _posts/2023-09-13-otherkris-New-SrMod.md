Today, we're thrilled to promote **otherkris** to the role of Senior Moderator!

Kris has been a part of our community and the staff team for a long time, and his passion and commitment have made a real difference. In his new role as Senior Moderator, he'll be helping speed up review of appeals and reports, and assist the senior moderator team with other duties.

Additionally, due to his location, Kris will be able to provide valuable support during peak hours for our Oceanic and Asian communities, ensuring a more responsive moderation experience for our global user base.
