                        <li>Players may be asked to screenshare if they are suspected of using an illegal advantage.</li>
                        <li>Players must remove all Minecraft <code>cheats</code> (Damage indicator included) and <code>Autoclickers</code> at least one hour before the tournament.</li>
                        <li>Players who have the possibility to change the <code>"Debounce Time"</code> of their mouse must set it to no less than <code>10ms</code> to reduce the possibility of double clicks.</li>

                        <li>Players must not delete or change anything (programs, files, mouse settings, etc.) during or after the game</li>
                        <li>Refusing to screenshare will result in a <b>Tournament Ban</b>.</li>
                        <li>As soon as a player is brought into the Screenshare room, they must activate Discord’s screenshare feature immediately and without further inquiry. <i>The entire screen must be shared</i>.</li>
                        <li>After that, the Staff Team will continue the screen sharing with <code>Anydesk</code>. Players must activate the mouse and keyboard control.</li>
                        <li>The Staff Team has several screen sharing tools at their disposal. <i>Not downloading them will be considered denying to screenshare</i>.</li>

                     <ol>
                    		   <li><b>Warnings:</b> For any minor offence, the player will receive a <code>warning</code>. This is mainly due to toxicity, spamming or any minor block glitching that does not change the outcome of the match (e.g, block glitching to avoid death in mid). <i>A fourth warning will result in a <b>punishment</b> for that player</i>.</li>
                            <li><b>Punishments:</b> The player will miss the next map for the first <code>punishment</code> and the rest of the series for the second one. The Staff Team will be giving punishments for things like extreme toxicity (harassment, being extremely toxic, etc), stream sniping, block glitching and changing the outcome of a match (e.g. getting out of the wool while block glitching, getting into the wool block glitching, getting proximity that changes the final result while block glitching, etc.) or by receiving <code>3 warnings</code>. <i>A third punishment will result in a <b>Tournament Ban</b></i>.</li>
                            <li><b>Tournament Ban:</b> This is the worst type of punishment a player may get. A team can receive up to three <code>Tournament Bans</code> before being disqualified from the tournament. This is reserved for extreme cases such as hacking or receiving up to <code>3 punishments</code>. For the first two Tournament Bans, the player will be disqualified from the tournament and the team will be given a loss for every map that player has played during that series. For the third one, the team will be disqualified from the tournament. <i>All players being issued a Tournament Ban will be <b>blacklisted</b> from future tournaments</i>.</li>
