Hey everyone! Welcome to Overcast Community’s 1st ever Map Making Competition! 
![Contest]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/img/blog/ctw_contest/mapmaking_contest.png %})

# General Format
This event will revolve around a **3 week** period where players will compete at making the best **Mega/Giga-sized CTW map** they can achieve. You can have a group of people help you or you can make it yourself,
as long as it's completed and submitted within 3 weeks you are qualified for judging.

Once the maps are submitted they will all be playtested on our public servers and judges will rank each map to determine the winners.

## Criteria & Submissions
Your map must be built to hold **at least 64 (32v32) players and a maximum of 100 (50v50)**. We are NOT accepting map submissions that hold more than 4 teams, so please keep it to 2 or 4. Ideally, our judges are mostly looking for 50v50 maps to fill in the Giga pool as it is very low on high-quality CTW maps. Your map should be built with 1.7/1.8 users in mind.

Each map is limited to a maximum of 4 authors and you can create multiple maps. Your highest ranked map will be the only one that counts towards prizes.

There will be no registration for this competition, instead, in order to be part of this event you must submit a map before the time limit is up to our [CommunityMaps GitHub page]({{ site.data.links.github | append: '/CommunityMaps/issues' }}). Please include the ‘contest’ label on your submission on GitHub.

Your map must not have been previously built/submitted to any server before this contest announcement.

## Official Dates
All official hours are in EST/New York (UTC -5).

 - **Submissions close/building ends:** July 30th @ 11:59pm EST
 - **Map testing:** July 31st - Aug 3rd
 - **Results:** Aug 4th

## XML
XML documents are to be included with the submission. XML must be at least protocol 1.4.0. Users are encouraged to learn and create their XML to the best of their abilities. Judges will be in charge of making sure that the XML is functional and we will edit them if there are any mistakes. If a notable mistake is found you will be contacted to see how you wanted it to play out. 

For those new to XML, we highly suggest looking at other map’s XMLs and trying to copy as much from there as most things that change are coordinates.

## Scoring
While previous map making competitions on Overcast Network have included a scoring criteria, we want to try something else this time around which is ranking all of the maps. We don’t want to have people focus on things like innovation and aesthetics which can take away from the focus on creating good gameplay. The judge’s overall rankings will be public by the end of the contest.

Speaking of judges, who are they? Most judges will be our Map Developers but we may reach out to some other staff or map makers who don’t participate in this contest to judge. Strangey will be the Head Judge as he is the one organizing this event and you may refer to him for any questions you may have regarding the contest.

Confirmed Judges:  

 - Strangey [Head Judge]  
 - Crazy_  
 - mame_BT

# Map Making Server
We’re always looking to help our map building community by introducing new tools and services. With this contest, we’re launching a closed beta of our map making server. This will be an ever evolving experience, designed with PGM maps in mind. We plan to release new features on a regular basis with a public launch later this summer. 

To request access, please contact a mapdev for more information.
