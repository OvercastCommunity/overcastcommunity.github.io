We are expanding the admin team!

**Strangey**, **Campeh** and **Siceth** have been promoted to administrator. We hope this will improve the efficiency and communication within the staff and the community.

**Indicado** will be incorporated into top level discussions with the admins as Head of [Bolt](https://bolt.rip).

## Strangey

The Strange Boy has been around oc.tc for a long time. No one thought he would become a staff member on Overcast Network, until one day in early 2015, he became a junior moderator.

From moderator, to map developer, to running events, Strangey has collected his fair share of staff ranks over the years, and today we welcome him to the Admin team!

## Campeh_

Campeh has been a leading role in the PGM events scene. Since the closing of Overcast Network, Campeh has been running his own tournaments with great success.

Shortly after Overcast Community opened, we incorporated Campeh's events under the oc.tc umbrella, called Overcast Events. We hope Campeh, as an admin, is able to manage events even smoother.

## Siceth

Siceth has been around the community for quite some time, and was brought in as an advisor for the staff. With his excellent background he has been giving valuable thoughts and ideas for the staff team.
