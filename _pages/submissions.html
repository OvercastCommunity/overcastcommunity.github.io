      <p>
        Map submissions and map updates for {{ site.title }} are handled
        through our CommunityMaps repository on

        To submit a new map or update click “New issue” and select the

      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        Maps submitted to {{ site.title }} must meet a certain standard and
        specific level of quality. While this standard can be hard to quantify,
        the guidelines below exist as a useful framework to follow for map
        submissions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure that you have the rights to use all the content in your map.
          Do not use private content you do not have permission to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maps should be fully compatible with Minecraft 1.8 and avoid usage of
          blocks or features from later versions of the game. Worlds built in
          1.9-1.12 may be accepted as long as they are properly
          <a href="https://github.com/mitchts/nbt-converter" target="_blank">NBT converted to support 1.8</a>, 
          and make use of no blocks or features from those versions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before your map submission ensure that you have a fully working
          map.xml file, the map files have been pruned, and you have created a
          map.png at <code>290x246</code> resolution.
        </li>
        <li>
          All map.xml files for new map submissions must be in proto <code>1.4.2</code> and follow standard
          <a href="https://pgm.dev/docs/guides/xml-pointers/conventions/" target="_blank">PGM XML conventions</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid maps that are highly derivative of other maps or do little to
          stand out as unique when compared to similar maps, especially those in
          oversaturated gamemodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maps that are submitted must meet our quality standards before
          being loaded for testing. Maps must also be designed in a way that is
          compatible with usage upon our servers and avoid usage of mechanics
          that may significantly hinder the ability to use a submitted map.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure you are willing and able to provide updates to your map based
          upon feedback received within a timely manner. Map submissions that
          remain inactive for long periods of time may be closed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be aware that all maps submitted to {{ site.title }} are publicly
          released under the
          <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-SA license</a>, 
          and that edits may be made to your map by Map Developers if needed.
          Edits made by Map Developers will mainly be to fix bugs or other
          issues with submitted maps, and major design changes will generally be
          left to the original author(s) to implement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Map submissions which do not fully meet these guidelines may be
          rejected, and will require changes to be made to rectify this before
          the map may be reconsidered.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Creating Maps</h2>
      <p>
        To aid potential mapmakers in creating maps, {{ site.title }} features
        a mapmaking server designed with PGM map creation in mind. The server
        features many useful plugins including WorldEdit, Arceon, and multiple
        custom plugins tailored specifically for PGM mapmaking. Further details
        can be found in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/mapmaker.html %}">Mapmaker</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to help create the map.xml file for new maps, many great public
        community resources are available. These include the many community maps
        within our
        <a href="{{ site.data.links.github | append: '/CommunityMaps' }}" target="_blank">repositories</a>, 
        the main <a href="https://pgm.dev" target="_blank">documentation site for PGM</a>,
        and the <code>#mapmaking</code> channel within
        <a href="{{ site.data.links.discord }}">{{ site.title }}'s Discord server</a>.
        These community resources collectively greatly aid in map development
        and should easily allow anyone the ability to create new maps for
        {{ site.title }}.
