For a long time we have discussed opening up new map submissions, and now it is finally happening!

The submission window is going to be open indefinitely, so no worries about submitting your map super fast. This post will go through the submission process and answer some obvious questions, be sure to read everything! 

## The submission process

Submissions will be done [here](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/CommunityMaps/issues). To make a new submission click **New issue** and use the template **Map submission** by clicking the green **Get started** button. After the submission is completed and submitted, make sure to not update your post unnecessarily, as submissions will be processed from oldest to newest.


## FAQ

### I don't know how to "test my map locally", can i submit it without testing?

No, please look [here](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/blob/master/docs/RUNNING.md) for a tutorial about how to set up your own local PGM server for testing. If you need help with setting up the server you can send a message in #debug over at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CvJGbrV).

### I don't know XML, what do i do?

If you need help with your XML you can read through the documentation over at [pgm.dev](https://pgm.dev) or ask for help in #maps in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CvJGbrV). (There is also currently a tool in development which will make anyone be able to make XML on a public map dev server)

### Can my submission get closed for inactivity?

Yes, if you get a response on your submission make sure to respond to it before 7 days has passed. Any submission with a reply from a map dev which is inactive for 7 days will be closed. Do not re-open closed issues!

### What happenes if my submission gets accepted?
If your submission gets accepted for testing, hooray! Your map will be added to a pool of maps which will be tested on public servers. If more changes are needed before putting the map up on the public rotation feedback will be posted on the same issue you originally opened.
