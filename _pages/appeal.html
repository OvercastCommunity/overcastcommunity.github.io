      <h2>What can be appealed?</h2>
      <p>Mistakes happen! If you feel your punishment should not have been issued we encourage you to appeal.</p>
      <p>Bans can be appealed and reduced, even if the ban was justified, but only unjustified mutes can be appealed.</p>
      <p>If there was a mistake, or the ban was issued a long time ago, we may consider giving you a second chance.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>What to expect?</h2>
      <p>Our senior moderator team reviews each submitted appeal on a case by case basis.</p>
      <p>Be prepared to respond promptly to any questions we may have, remaining polite and courteous, as that may influence our final decision.</p>
      <p>After reviewing all evidence and conferring internally, we'll make a decision on your appeal and inform you within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
